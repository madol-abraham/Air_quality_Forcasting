# Air Quality Forecasting

# project overview
Air pollution has become a pressing concern globally due to its adverse impact on human health, climate change and the environment. In Beijing, the effects of high PM2.5 levels are deep, affecting millions of residents. This task aims to predict the PM2.5 concentrations using a Time series forecasting technique based on the historical  air quality data provided for this project. I chose to use the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm. I decided to navigate a learning path on how deep learning can assist in forecasting air pollution levels and see better ways to contribute to public health strategies and policies that drive informed decisions.

## üåç Problem Statement

Air pollution, particularly PM2.5, poses severe health and environmental risks. This project aims to predict PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing using historical air quality and meteorological data.

## üîç Approach

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized distributions, trends, and missing values.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extracted cyclical time features (hour, month, season).
   - Engineered meteorological features like `temp_dew_diff = TEMP - DEWP`.
   - Computed rolling averages (6-hour, 24-hour) for trend analysis.
3. **Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values in `pm2.5`.
   - Standardized features using `StandardScaler`.
   - Scaled target (`PM2.5`) with `MinMaxScaler`.
4. **Modeling**:
   - Built and tuned Bidirectional LSTM models.
   - Regularized with Dropout and L2.
   - Added Batch Normalization and Gradient Clipping.
5. **Evaluation**:
   - Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R¬≤.
   - Visualization: Predicted vs Actual, Loss Curves.

## üìä Results

| Metric   | Value  |
|----------|---------|
| RMSE     | 75.75   |
| MAE      | 50.69   |
| R¬≤ Score | 0.50    |
